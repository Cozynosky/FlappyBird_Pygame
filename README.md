Introduction
============
I just wanted to test mu pygame skills after one week of learing it, so it is basically Flappy Bird in pygame.
I've just stole assets and sounds from the Internet :)))) and made this game in not all two days so I am kinda proud of myself.

Game mechanics
-------------
You can jump by hitting space or mouse left button, there are sound when jumping, dying.
The bird rotates when he is falling until he is ground faced.
You will fall faster and faster depends on how long you are falling and there are maybe some more features but not worth mentionig.
